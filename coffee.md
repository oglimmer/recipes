Freshly brewed U.S. style coffee
================================

Ever asked yourself how to recreate diner style coffee?

Two key ingredients: strong, dark coffee and half and half.

Half and half usually has 10% to 12% of fat. So if we mix 100 ml 3.5% whole milk and 50 ml 32% heavy cream, we end up with a dairy product with 13% of fat - close enough.

Here's my favorite 'recipe':

* Use 15g of freshly ground dark roast beans to brew 250 ml of coffee
* Mix 100ml 3.5% whole milk / Vollmilch (65 kcal) and 50ml 32% heavy cream / Schlagsahne (175 kcal), heat it up and add it to the coffee
* Finally, I use 1Â½ sugar cubes (25 kcal)

This results in 400ml of very tasty coffee and it comes to 265 kcal in total.
