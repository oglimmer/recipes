# Oli's Red Chili with Beans

### Fry in pan

* ~800g / 30oz of ground beef
* For germans: I usually use "beef/pork mix" ground
* make sure the meat gets brown and not just grey.
* if it gets grey crank up the heat or fry in smaller portions

### Fry in pan

* 16 chili peppers, chopped
* buy whatever chilli peppers you can get, I usually get a variety of peppers
* you may want to remove the seeds to reduce the heat
* fry with a tea spoon of oil for 2-3 minutes

### Fry in pan

* one large onion, chopped
* one bulb (sic!) of garlic, chopped
* fry with a tea spoon of oil for 2-3 minutes

### Fry in pan

* This is optional, but it increases the fruitiness
* 1 zucchini, chunked in smaller pieces
* fry with a tea spoon of oil for 2-3 minutes

### Add to a large pot

* everything from the frying actions
* 5 table spoons of olive oil
* 1200g / 40oz of peeled tomatos [1]
* 3 bell peppers, chunked
* 2 table spoons of honey
* a cup of Whiskey
* 2 table spoons of ground cumin
* 2 table spoons of sweet paprika powder
* 2 table spoons of smoked paprika powder

=> Cook on low-medium heat for at least 45 minutes, better 1h.

### Add

* can of corn
* can of kidney beans [3]
* can of pinto beans
* can of black beans [2]

* if the beans come in some sort of sauce, wash them under running water before adding to the pot
